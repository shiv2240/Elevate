// Entry Criteria in Software Testing
These are the preconditions that must be satisfied before testing begins. They ensure that the testing team is ready and that the software is in a stable enough state to test.

// Common entry criteria examples:

Requirements and specifications are complete and reviewed: Testers need clear, finalized requirements to design test cases.

Test environment is set up and stable: Hardware, software, network configurations should be ready to run tests.

Test data is prepared: Input data needed for test scenarios is available.

Test cases are written and reviewed: Test cases must be ready and approved.

Build is available: The software build to be tested is delivered and installed.


These are the conditions that must be met to consider testing complete for a particular phase or cycle.

// Common exit criteria examples:

All planned test cases executed: The test suite has been run.

All critical and high severity bugs are fixed or deferred: No showstopper issues remain open.

Defect density and test coverage meet agreed thresholds: Enough of the software has been tested.

Test summary report completed: Results are documented and reviewed.

Sign-off from stakeholders: Business or QA approves the test completion.

Why is this important in software testing?
Ensures readiness: You don’t start testing on incomplete or unstable software.

Defines done: Clear criteria for when testing is sufficient to move forward.

Helps manage risks: Avoids releasing software with critical issues.

Improves communication: All stakeholders know the “rules” for starting and ending testing.
