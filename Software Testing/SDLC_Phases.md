1. Like we need to understand what we actually want
(deciding the features like what type of website would be there, a product, a cart or getting orders or making a purchase)


2. plan everything and discusss about design part
The work flow of the app should be planned as in how it will connect to other parts. Also, will it be a monolith or a micro service bases product.
First we will plan about figma designs along with that we can decide where and how the product data will get stored.
which databse we will have to use like SQL or NoSQL.
Planning of which Tech or technologies we will gonna use in it.

3. The coding or development phase
Make the code for frontend and backend but initially the code development part will be done by backend and the pre-decided tech stack and then the testing phase for backend and once gets approved then the frontend developmemnt will get started. Also, on each step, the testing must be done so that debugging would be easier.

4. testing phase
First test for any frontend bugs like order statyus is showing properly, the user data is correctly linked with the user's id or database.
Does the payment is working fine?

5. Deployment
Put the app online and get some feedbacks in the initial phase and make sure the user can use it smoothly.

6. Maintainence
Team must check for the bugs and fix them in the patch updates and for minor updates, there should be update and testing within a suhgested tome and then the last stage for major updates which can be checked and rolled out so that new features can be implemented successfully/
